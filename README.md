## üîç Understanding the Code (For Curious Users)

This project contains two main parts:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ C# Code (`MainWindow.xaml.cs`)**
- Manages the **logic** of the calculator.
- Handles button clicks and performs arithmetic operations.
- Uses a `switch` statement to determine the operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- Prevents **division by zero** errors.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ XAML Code (`MainWindow.xaml`)**
- Defines the **visual interface** (buttons, labels, layout).
- Uses a **Grid layout** to arrange buttons neatly.
- Applies styles to make the calculator look clean and user-friendly.
